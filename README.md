# Overview of the Final Mini Project
This project contain two language C & C#
<br/>
<br/>
C language: I have programmed the STM32F072RBTx to be able controlled encoder dc motor such as direction, speed of spain, angle degree and write & read USART.
<br/>
<br/>
C# language: I have created a GUI to be able controlled encoder dc motor such as direction, speed of spain, read angle degree and write & read USART and display stm32 device ID. 

# Time Expenditures:

1. Final Mini Project: Predicted Hours:35  Actual Hours: 4 weeks
